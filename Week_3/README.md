# Art swap social media sytle website
The main goal would be to make an instagram style navigatinal website for art blogs.
The artists would in theory be able explore blog pages and either "follow" or request a swap
For the midterm I would like to begin formating the website without the complexities of outside blogs. 
I would like to make the discover page that pulls images from a couple example portfolios/blogs. 
Then I would like to to develope the blog page format and create buttons for opening an email
